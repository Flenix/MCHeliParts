REGARDING MODPACKS:
You may include my mod in a modpack, but must do all of the following BEFORE including it:
- 1. Send me a message, telling me you are doing so
- 2. Include in the message a link to where you will be hosting the pack, and any other info about the pack you like.
- 3. Ensure you have permission to distribute ALL the mods in your modpack. It’s well worth having a public permission list (eg on Google Drive) with the names of every mod, its author, and where the mod can be downloaded. ATL users, this is automatically done for you.

You may not make any money off my mod, unless you've discussed with me first. This includes things like adfly.
General server donations are acceptible so long as you're running multiple mods (not just mine).
