MCHeliParts

A small utility mod designed to be used with MCHeli and hardmode mods such as GregTech in order to create much harder recipes.

In order to use:
- Modify ALL of your MCHeli vehicles, removing their recipe (just delete the recipe line)
- Install MineTweaker, and use parts from this mod as your new recipes
